# Image Segmentation and CIE L*a*b* Color Analysis

## Overview

This script performs segmentation and color analysis of fruits in an image with a white background. The script identifies individual fruits and calculates their color properties in the CIE L*a*b* color space, area, and position.

### Key Features
- Detects individual fruits from an image.
- Calculates average CIE L*a*b* color values for each fruit.
- Computes area, centroid, and bounding box for each segmented region.

## Requirements

To run the script, install the following Python libraries:
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-image`
- `pandas`

Install them using:
```bash
pip install matplotlib scikit-image pandas
